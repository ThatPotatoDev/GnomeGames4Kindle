"Chess is played on a square chessboard, consisting of 64 squares of "
"alternating color. Each player begins the game with sixteen pieces: one "
"king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. One "
"player controls the white pieces and the other player controls the black "
"pieces; the player that controls white is the first to move. The players "
"take turns moving pieces; certain moves involve a \"capturing\" of an "
"opponent's piece, removing it from the chessboard. The object of the game is "
"to checkmate the opponent's king. This occurs when the king is under "
"immediate attack (in check) and there is no way to remove it from attack on "
"the next move. Theoreticians have developed extensive chess strategies and "

"equivalent, Vladimir Kramnik, is the 14th Champion in the lineage. There are "
